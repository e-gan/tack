# IDEA

# Objective
Optimal work pattern algorithm

objective: maximize efficiency
inspo: VSCode todo tree

alternate goal: maximize time in flow state (flow state is harder to quantify)


task (toggle)
- link (clickable)  [checkbox]
- link
 
----------------------------------------------

# Features

summary stats (sidebar?)
toggle (daily/weekly/all-time)
hyperlink tasks back to specific places (sections of a tab)


Tasks completed
Average task size:
- ideal size (time entered to time completed)
- prevents misuse don't want to track time spent on related tabs

Categories (example)
- productivity (time task is listed)
- research
- anti-productivity

 ----------------------------------------------

# Gamified parts

assign characters (MTBI) (update as you keep working w this thing)
- one hit wonder
- Anteater (lots of small tasks)
- The Flash 
- Odysseus (long tasks)
- Renissance man (all types)
- emotions based on how long its been since you added a task (no! - emily)
- stressed if too many tasks (no! - emily)

checking off a task
- little confetti

 ----------------------------------------------

# Flow state

how to measure flow state: (as obscure as possible)
- interaction with the browser (time between interactions < 1min?)
- idleness
- task completion
- time/something in anti-productivity category

types of productivity:
- reading
- writing (code/text)
- watch videos
- emails
- ChatGPT...
- coding
    - running code stats (google colab, jupyter?)
        

types of anti-productivity:
- social media browsing
- streaming
- gaming

Experiment:
- Track everything you do on a laptop for a day and see what stats come up
